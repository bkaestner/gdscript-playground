# GDScript "Demo" Repository

This repository contains some GDScript-only demonstrations of several Nodes. In
general, *this is a bad idea*, since you lose a lot of the nice features that
Godot's editor offers, for example discoverability via the scene tree.

As there is only a single node per screen (and all those nodes are only Node2D),
the snippets within the `"*_demo.gd"` files are all self-contained. You can just
create a new scene based on a Node2D, grab the script, add it do the node, and
then run the scene (usually bound to F6).

Again, this whole repository is a bad idea. But I personally learn a programming 
language better by using it the hard way.
